I am a full stack data scientist and statistician. I've worked at Udemy, Uber and am currently at Shipt. At Udemy and Uber, my work centered around statistical methodologies, data pipelines, and experimentation education. At Shipt, I apply reinforcement learning (mab) and NLP techniques to optimize our search and recommendation system and advertising.

I enjoy working in the intersection of ML/statistics and software engineering.

Prior to tech, I worked as a economic and legal consultant at Analysis Group, Inc. 

I have a Ph.D. in Economics from Stanford University.

In my free time, I enjoy spending time with my 3 sons, 2 cats, 1 wife, and listen to a small but growing record collection.
