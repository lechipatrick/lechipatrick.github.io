I am a data scientist and economist. 

My data science journey officially started in 2016, when I became a Data Science for Social Good fellow. During that summer, I worked with some really awesome people to use machine learning to better allocate resource to reduce juvenile  delinquency in Milwaukee. After graduating from my PhD program, I then worked as a computational social scientist at the Pew Research Center, where I experimented with various data science, survey, machine and deep learning techniques to write about gender representation in [news](https://www.journalism.org/2019/05/23/men-appear-twice-as-often-as-women-in-news-photos-on-facebook/), [online searches](https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2018/12/17/gender-and-jobs-in-online-image-searches/), [political polarization](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/02/01/theres-a-large-gender-gap-in-congressional-facebook-posts-about-sexual-misconduct/), [Americans' interest in guns](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/03/16/what-google-searches-can-tell-us-about-americans-interest-in-guns/), among other work. I also contributed to various technical tutorials on [medium](https://medium.com/@onyilam). Since then, I had a brief stint as a Research Scientist with FiscalNote, a startup that builds a legislative tracking platform. Most recently, I am a Senior Data Scientist at Mission Lane, a fintecth startup that aims to provide more equitable access to fiancial services for the underserved.

I graduated with a PhD in Economics from University of California, San Diego in 2017. In my [dissertation](https://escholarship.org/content/qt76c987rx/qt76c987rx.pdf), I examined the effect of political salience on advertisers' decisions in ad allocation across different media outlets. Before the PhD program, I was awarded the Japanese government scholarship (MEXT) to study public policy at the University of Tokyo, and graduated with the Best Student Award. I also have an engineering degree from UC Berkeley.

I speak English, Cantonese and Japanese, and I have a penchant for projects at the intersection of technology and social science. I am a lifelong learner, always fascinated by new discoveries and progress in science. In my free time, I like to play the violin, and hang out with my dog jarjar.

I am a U.S. citizen and a proud Hong Kong-er.
