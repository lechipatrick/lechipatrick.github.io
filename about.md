I am a full stack data scientist and statistician. I've worked at Udemy, Uber and currently work at Shipt. At Udemy, I focused on revammping the experimentation analysis system. At Uber, I worked on statistical methods pertaining to marketplace experimentation. At Shipt, I apply reinforcement learning (mab) and NLP techniques to optimize our search and recommendation, as well as retail media.

I enjoy working in the intersection of ML/statistics and engineering. I like to identify an business problem, develop a ML/stats solution for it, implement and productionize my model, either as a batch job or, even more exciting, a real time API. I enjoy writing high quality code and following engineering best practices.

Prior to tech, I worked as a economic and legal consultant at Analysis Group, Inc. 

I have a Ph.D. in Economics from Stanford University.

In my free time, I play with my 3 sons, 2 cats, and listen to my small but growing record collection.
