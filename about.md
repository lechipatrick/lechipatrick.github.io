I am a data scientist and statistician. I've worked at Udemy, Uber and currently working at Shipt. At Udemy, I focused on revammping the experimentation analysis system. At Uber, I worked on statistical methods pertaining to marketplace experimentation. At Shipt, I apply reinforcement learning (mab) and NLP techniques to optimize our search and recommendation, as well as retail media.
