I am a full stack data scientist and statistician. I've worked at Udemy, Uber and currently work at Shipt. At Udemy and Uber, my work centered around statistical methodologies, data pipelines, and experimentation education. At Shipt, I apply reinforcement learning (mab) and NLP techniques to optimize our search and recommendation, as well as retail media.

I enjoy working in the intersection of ML/statistics and engineering. I like to identify an business problem, develop a ML/stats solution for it, implement and productionize my model, either as a batch job or, even more exciting for me, a realtime API.

Prior to tech, I worked as a economic and legal consultant at Analysis Group, Inc. 

I have a Ph.D. in Economics from Stanford University.

In my free time, I play with my 3 sons, 2 cats, and listen to my small but growing record collection.
